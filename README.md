# dl-manga
Python program to help save manga more efficiently

I kinda just made this in a quick rush, because I couldn't be bothered to save each picture on its own, so I just threw it together and got it running.

Todo:
- Clean up the comments
- Complete the error messages
- Add some more functionality
- Make it more generic so as to work on other types of sites -- I generally made this to work with mangakakalot.com, so I'm not too sure what other sites it'd work on, at the moment

Requires:
- BeautifulSoup/BS4 (https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
